Adjustments to be made for raid organizer in no particular order

Roster Tab
- Allow searching of the character within the roster so you dont have to manually find the player. 
- Add something (Checkbox/Dropdown/Open to suggestions) for denoting if a character is a Main/Alt. 
	- Alts should be be naturally flagged in lower prio than that of a main?(There are special cases here) 

Slotting Tab
- The optimize raid button should pull from the table of players to create the comp
- Allow per boss comp variations IE, 2 Tanks, 3 Healers, 15 DPS Slotted on Stix, but on Mug'zee you have 2 Tanks, 5 Healers, 15 DPS. 
	-This however will cause problems due to the fact of how people are flagged healing and dps i do not know the best possible solution for an automated tool
	-One potential solve is adding some sort of "flex" indicator to players
- Add Ability to drag and drop players to different sections per boss. IE Stix has 3 healers, Mugzee has 5 healers, Travis on priest is in the raid he would be healer dragged to Healer on Mugzee. 


- The Raid comp should not be a total for the entire raid but per boss - IDK What this meant

- Need to add boss loot tables - In progress almost done
- Need to add players bis items - Huge Workload not sure how to implement

- Probably want 3 slotting buttons? 
	1 Based on player weighting(Slot the 20 highest weighted plays with a distribution of 2 tanks 4 healers 14 dps)
	1 Based on splits for effective gearing(So average weighting score / 3 with an even distribution)
