Adjustments to be made for raid organizer in no particular order

- Allow searching of the character within the roster so you dont have to manually find the player. 


- The optimize raid button should pull from the table of players to create the comp
- The Raid comp should not be a total for the entire raid but per boss

- Need to add boss loot tables
- Need to add players bis items

- Role Balancing per boss raid comp? IE, Vexie is 2 tanks 2 healers 16 dps, Stix is 2 tank, 3 healer, 15 dps and buttons will check the distribution before slotting?

- Probably want 3 slotting buttons? 
	1 Based on player weighting(Slot the 20 highest weighted plays with a distribution of 2 tanks 4 healers 14 dps)
	1 Based on splits for effective gearing(So average weighting score / 3 with an even distribution)
	

Next Steps - Deepseek Recommendation
- Drag and drop functionality in the slotting tab to move players
